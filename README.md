## More information

### Why this?

Well, I grew tired of having to sort through forums, blogs, books, videos, etc. to get the information I want.

Since more people are in the same boat as me and I will probably need to go through this information in the future why not compile everything and upload it somewhere and save some time for other people and future me. 

### Why github?

It all comes down to three reasons.

  * I like Git
  * I like Markdown
  * It's easy to create mirrors
